# Developer Manual (Windows, Python)

Target environment: Windows 10/11, Python 3.11+

## Tools
- Python standard library only for implementation
- `unittest` (stdlib) for tests
- `trace` (stdlib) for line coverage

## Open the project
- Recommended IDE: VS Code (Python extension) or PyCharm
- Open the folder `Year3-COMP3211-SE-Group-Project`

## Run the game
```powershell
python -m cli.main
```

## Run unit tests
```powershell
python -m unittest
```

## Generate coverage report (model package)
```powershell
python .\run_tests_with_coverage.py
```
- Output directory: `tests/coverage/`
- Files with extension `.cover` and `SUMMARY.txt` are generated by stdlib `trace`

## Debugging
- In VS Code, set the launch program to `${workspaceFolder}/cli/main.py`
- Put breakpoints in `model/*` or `cli/main.py`

## Project structure
- `model/`: game rules, board, pieces, game state (the “Model”)
- `cli/`: command-line interface (the “View/Controller”)
- `tests/`: `unittest`-based unit tests for the model
- `records/`: sample `.record` and `.jungle` files
- `docs/`: SRS, Design, manuals, slides outline

## Python version
- Developed and tested with Python 3.11
- If you use a different version, adapt if needed (stdlib only)
